A collection of concepts from parallel computing implemented in C++.

This repo emerged from my effort to internalize the contents of the course *"Advanced Topics in Parallel Computing"* held at the University of Munich (LMU).

Each .cpp file defines a class that implements the concept described by its filename, along with a main function that briefly demonstrates or tests its behavior.
The files are intended to be compiled and run individually, not linked together into a single executable or library.
