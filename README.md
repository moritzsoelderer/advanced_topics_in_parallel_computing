A collection of concepts from parallel computing implemented in C++.

This repo emerged from my effort to internalize the contents of the course *"Advanced Topics in Parallel Computing"* held at the University of Munich (LMU).

Each file contains a class as an implementation of the concept in the file name and a main method which briefly "test" or rather showcases the mechanism.
Therefore each .cpp file should be treated individually and not tried to be linked and compiled into a shared library or single executable.
